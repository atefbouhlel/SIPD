/**
 * <P>A connection (session) with a specific
 * database. SQL statements are executed and results are returned
 * within the context of a connection.
 * <P>
 * A <code>Connection</code> object's database is able to provide information
 * describing its tables, its supported SQL grammar, its stored
 * procedures, the capabilities of this connection, and so on. This
 * information is obtained with the <code>getMetaData</code> method.
 *
 * <P><B>Note:</B> When configuring a <code>Connection</code>, JDBC applications
 *  should use the appropritate <code>Connection</code> method such as
 *  <code>setAutoCommit</code> or <code>setTransactionIsolation</code>.
 *  Applications should not invoke SQL commands directly to change the connection's
 *   configuration when there is a JDBC method available.  By default a <code>Connection</code> object is in
 * auto-commit mode, which means that it automatically commits changes
 * after executing each statement. If auto-commit mode has been
 * disabled, the method <code>commit</code> must be called explicitly in
 * order to commit changes; otherwise, database changes will not be saved.
 * <P>
 * A new <code>Connection</code> object created using the JDBC 2.1 core API
 * has an initially empty type map associated with it. A user may enter a
 * custom mapping for a UDT in this type map.
 * When a UDT is retrieved from a data source with the
 * method <code>ResultSet.getObject</code>, the <code>getObject</code> method
 * will check the connection's type map to see if there is an entry for that
 * UDT.  If so, the <code>getObject</code> method will map the UDT to the
 * class indicated.  If there is no entry, the UDT will be mapped using the
 * standard mapping.
 * <p>
 * A user may create a new type map, which is a <code>java.util.Map</code>
 * object, make an entry in it, and pass it to the <code>java.sql</code>
 * methods that can perform custom mapping.  In this case, the method
 * will use the given type map instead of the one associated with
 * the connection.
 * <p>
 * For example, the following code fragment specifies that the SQL
 * type <code>ATHLETES</code> will be mapped to the class
 * <code>Athletes</code> in the Java programming language.
 * The code fragment retrieves the type map for the <code>Connection
 * </code> object <code>con</code>, inserts the entry into it, and then sets
 * the type map with the new entry as the connection's type map.
 * <pre>
 *      java.util.Map map = con.getTypeMap();
 *      map.put("mySchemaName.ATHLETES", Class.forName("Athletes"));
 *      con.setTypeMap(map);
 * </pre>
